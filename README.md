#ðŸ”¢  program-1 Simple Calculator 

This is a basic calculator implemented using a JavaScript class. It supports the following operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Accepts two numeric inputs (`a` and `b`) as `double` values.
- Accepts an operation type as a string: `"addition"`, `"subtraction"`, `"multiplication"`, `"division"`.
- Handles division by zero gracefully.


# ðŸ”¢ Program-2 Odd Number Series Generator

This program generates a series of odd numbers based on a single integer input `n`.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Takes a single integer input.
- Outputs the first `n` odd numbers starting from 1.
- Uses a simple arithmetic formula: `2 * i + 1`.


# ðŸ”¢ Program-3 Odd Number Series Generator

This program generates a series of odd numbers based on a single integer input `n`.  
If `n` is even, it outputs the first `n-1` odd numbers.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Takes a single integer input.
- If input is odd, outputs the first `n` odd numbers starting from 1.
- If input is even, outputs the first `n-1` odd numbers starting from 1.
- Uses the arithmetic formula: `2 * i + 1` to generate odd numbers.

- # ðŸ”¢ Program-4 Multiple Counts in Array

This program takes an array of numbers and counts how many numbers are multiples of each integer from 1 to 9.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Accepts an array of integers as input.
- Checks multiples for numbers from 1 to 9.
- Returns an object with keys 1 through 9 and their corresponding counts.
- Uses modulus operator `%` to check for multiples.
